# VA Hack The Throne

Dear Juniors,
Welcome to our first ever comfortable, most relaxed, sit back and enjoy,"THE GREAT VA-HACK THE THRONE".

People usually think of playing the game of thrones, beeing the computer scientist, let's try and hack the throne. Without wasting any time lets dive in.

Your task is to create a web page using whatever you have learned so far and in the most creative way possible whereby we have a picture preferably but not necessarily of you and a small description about your self, who are you? what are your skills? what do you love to do? etc. This webpage when I see as an unknown person, it should introduced me to all 5 of you digitally. You are free to design your content, present your ideas in the way that you like.

4 Things to keep in mind when designing and implementing webpage:
1. use of git and Github to be in sync. also please use Vscode to write your code.
2. using HTML, CSS and materialize CSS.
3. taking care of all the web3c semantics.
4. use of the same repo with different branches if necessary on Github.

 This is the repository you will be using to colaborate.

The time to finish the task would be 1 hour.
we start at 7.30 pm sharp and stop at 8.30.


I hope you all have a fun-loving learning experience where our motto is to teach and to learn. Please remember this,"You are a team, your success, and your failure should come out as a team and not an individual".

"We succeed when we help others succeed".

All the very best,
